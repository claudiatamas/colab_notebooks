# Machine Learning & Graph Theory Projects

This repository contains several notebooks with projects exploring different algorithms and concepts:

- Machine Learning algorithms such as **Naive Bayes** and **Nearest Neighbor**.  
- A graph theory project based on the **Vienna Subway network**.  

The notebooks demonstrate both practical implementation and theoretical understanding of these topics.
